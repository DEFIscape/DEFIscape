**DEFIscape** is a non-custodial web interface that helps users reclaim assets stuck in abandoned or deprecated DeFi protocols.
When UIs vanish, teams disappear, or hosting is shut down, staking contracts and LP vaults remain on-chain — but become inaccessible.
DEFIscape restores one-click access — directly from your wallet 

**DEFIscape restores access to these assets safely and transparently.**

## 🚨 Why DEFIscape Exists

Across EVM ecosystems, hundreds of millions of dollars are locked in outdated or abandoned systems:

| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧱 Staking Contracts | Users cannot call `withdraw()` or `exit()` because the UI is dead |
| 🧪 Deprecated LP Pools | LP tokens remain idle in V1/V2 vaults |
| 👻 Abandoned Farms | Teams vanished, websites offline |
| 🎁 Reward Systems | Unclaimed rewards stuck in reward contracts |
| 🕳 UI-less Protocols | Contracts function, but no interface exists |

Your funds aren’t lost — **they are simply inaccessible without a proper interface**.

## 🛠 Core Features

### 🔍 **Multi-Chain Wallet Scanner**
Automatically detects:

- Abandoned staking positions  
- Deprecated LP pools  
- Unclaimed rewards  
- Recoverable contract functions  
- Protocol status (active / risky / abandoned)  

🧠 Powered by **DeBank API** + custom dead-protocol classifier.

---

### 🧰 **Contract Interaction Engine**
Interact directly with DeFi contracts:

- Unstake from abandoned farms  
- Withdraw LP tokens  
- Claim pending rewards  
- Trigger `withdraw()`, `exit()`, `unstake()`, etc.  
- 100% non-custodial & wallet-based interactions  

All transactions are executed **from the user’s wallet only**.
